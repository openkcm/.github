## 🔧 **Best Practices**

Here are some best practices to ensure your contributions are top-notch!

### 🌿 **Branching and Commits**

- **Branches**: Use meaningful names like `feature/add-login` or `bugfix/fix-crash`. This makes it easy to know what the branch is about.
- **Commits**: Each commit should represent a single change. Don't bundle unrelated changes together.

### 🧪 **Writing Tests**

- We **love tests**! Write tests to cover your changes to ensure they work and prevent future bugs.
- If you're unsure about the test framework or coverage, reach out to a maintainer.

### 🎨 **Code Style**

- Follow existing **code style** conventions in the project.
- Indentation: 4 spaces.
- Use **camelCase** (JavaScript) or **snake_case** (Python) for variable names.
- Always use **meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes.

### ✏️ **Commit Message Guidelines**

Commit messages should follow this format:

- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **feat**: New features
- **docs**: Documentation updates
- **style**: Code style changes (e.g., formatting)
- **test**: Adding or modifying tests

Each commit message should be **short**, ideally under 50 characters, followed by a detailed description if necessary.

---

## 📚 **Using Issues Effectively**

1. **Always search** before opening a new issue to avoid duplicates.
2. **Labeling**: Use labels to categorize issues properly (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`).
3. **Assigning**: Assign an issue to yourself or someone else if you're working on it.

---

## 🔀 **Pull Requests Process**

Once you’ve made changes and created a pull request, the following process will apply:

### 👀 **Reviewing Pull Requests**

- All pull requests will be reviewed by maintainers.
- We expect respectful, clear feedback. If changes are requested, be sure to update your PR and resubmit.

### ⚔️ **Handling Merge Conflicts**

If your pull request has merge conflicts:

1. Pull the latest changes from `main`.
2. Resolve conflicts.
3. Re-run tests and push the updates.

## 🌍 **Community Engagement**

We love seeing new faces! You can contribute in more ways than just coding:

- **Participate** in discussions.
- **Help** answer questions or provide feedback to others.
- **Respect** everyone, regardless of their experience level.
