# Welcome to the Open Key Chain Manager (OpenKCM)

👋 Welcome to the official OpenKCM. We are part of ApeiroRA which is an Important Project of Common European Interest.

### 🌐 ApeiroRA?

ApeiroRA is a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum and therefore a key contribution to IPCEI-CIS. At a high level, the projects of ApeiroRA allow users to provider-agnostically fetch, request and consume services, and for service providers to describe, offer and provision their services.

By being open source, ApeiroRA provides a cross-border spillover effect, solidifying the foundation and future of the project.

Learn more about ApeiroRA by checking out the official website at https://apeirora.eu/.
